  <h1>Debut Album from Delta Deep</h1>
  <p>Def Leppard guitarist Phil Collen has released a new album with his blues-based music project, Delta Deep. Their debut album features a mix of original and hand-picked cover tracks, but stylistically it is not confined to any one genre.</p>

  <p>Collen enlisted the help of Stone Temple Pilots' bass player Robert DeLeo, singer Debbi Blackwell-Cook (backup vocalist for such artists as Michael Buble and Luther Vandross) and drummer Forrest Robinson (drummer for India.Arie, Joe Sample and the Crusaders, TLC) to create his new blues-, funk- and soul-flavored band.</p>

  <p>Check out one of the new tracks below, and make sure to download the entire album. Trust me, you will be glad you did!</p>
